NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day using the NASA APOD API.

This is version 1 of the NASA API Challenge. It was creeated using the NASA API, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No framewroks were used There are options to like an image, add the image to favorites, remove the image from favorites, view the image full screen and share the image using the Web Share API. 

A couple of the features are not working yet. They are below are will be rectified soon.

1. The likes will save but not delete.
2. The favorties page has no way to get back to the previous image.
3. No fallbback for the Web Share API (which has kinda poor browser support).
4. Favorites cards texts are off on mobile.
